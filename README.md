## Overview

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior. By applying clustering techniques, we aim to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies. This project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning to solve real-world business problems.

## Project Structure

- `Capstone 2 Cahaya Tambunan.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `data/`: Folder containing datasets used in the analysis (if applicable).
- `results/`: Folder storing outputs such as visualizations and final model files (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Open the `Capstone 2 Cahaya Tambunan.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to execute the analysis. The notebook is organized into sections, each addressing different stages of the customer segmentation process:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data through visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Modeling:** Applying clustering algorithms to segment customers.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of different models and selecting the best one.
5. **Business Insights:** Interpreting the results to generate actionable business insights.

## Results

The final section of the notebook presents the segmented customer groups, along with key characteristics of each group. These insights can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.
